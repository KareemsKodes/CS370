Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  The work that I did on this project was the implementation of the deep Q-learning algorithm that the pirate agent uses to learn its way through the maze. We were given all the setup code including the maze, the configuration for machine learning and importing of all dependencies. Analysis was also performed on how best to implement the algorithm as well as how to

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientiests use the power of computers to solve all sorts of problems ranging from small things like remembering to drink water with an app to really big things like self driving cars, healthcare software, or an algorithm that makes somesthing more efficient. What computer scientists do is make life easier for others with computers while also studying what computers can be made to do.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I usually evaluate all aspects of a prblem first. Once I know the problem, I can begin to try to address it. I will try solutions and see if they work or not. If they do not work, I will analyze what I did and what went wrong and try again. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The people who make all the technology are completely responsible for the implications of their technology. There are strong ethical responsiblities that force us all to consider what we do and how it affects the people around us and the world around us.
